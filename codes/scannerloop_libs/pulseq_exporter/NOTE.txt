The pulseq 1.4.0 file specification is more specific in many details, the most
important being the exact timing of events (e.g. ADC sample timing).

Additionally it adds time shapes, which means it is possible to have different
time resolutions for different shapes, even varying resolution within a single
shape (e.g. long adiabatic pulses don't need to blow up the file size anymore).

The pypulseq library does not support 1.4.0 yet.

This library implements the minimum functionality to export sequences to pulseq
1.4.0 .seq files. Where the specification is ambiguous, it adheres to what the
Siemens interpreter excpects.
Contrary to the (py)pulseq framework, pulseq_exporter does not implement any of
the additional helper functions that are not required for exporting and are not
part of the file specification (but it contains some common pulse shapes).
This library is not meant for writing sequences but only for exporting them,
e.g. to be used in conjunction with MRzero's sequence definitions.
