Dear all,

this was the first part of the MRI pulseq course.
Next week you can prepare your homework exercise on your own, but with help of me and my students.
Presentations of all exercises will then take place next Friday 9:30 to 3 pm in the CIP pool.

On Monday still some students will visit the scanner, see at the end of the mail.

On Tuesday 4 pm, Wednesday 5 pm and Thursday 5 pm  I will be available for questions on your exercises in the Zoom room.
Or anytime upon your request via email.
